        					<li> Procedural Thinking: is the process of taking problems and breaking it down into a series of steps to address the problem.</li>

        					<li> Abstract Thinking: is the process of using logic to get to the core of an abstract problem, e.g. one apple plus one apple equals two apples.  The core logic behind it is 1+1 = 2, even though you are using apples to replace the numbers.</li>

        					<li> Systematic Debugging:  the process of identifying problems and tracking it down to its cause to fix the problem</li>

        					<li> Technological Empathy: the process of understanding how the computer sees things</li>

        				<p> The internet is a collection of data.  Namely, HTML documents that are contained on <b><em>servers</em></b> and accessed by myself or others using a web brower.  HTML documents are comprised of <em><b>text context</b></em> (what I see), <em><b>markup</b></em> (what it looks like), <em><b> references </b></em> (other documents like images and videos) and <em><b> links </b></em> (links to other pages).</p>

        				<p><b>HTML</b> stands for <b>H</b>yper <b>T</b>ext <b>M</b>arkup <b>L</b>angauge.  This is the standard programming language used to make web pages.
        				</p>

        				<p> HTML is the main code that makes up webpages, and the internet as a whole.  Additionally when coding, HTML is the blueprint like that of a house.  HTML defines what and where everything is on the page.  Just like how a blueprint defines what and where rooms and things are of a house.

            			<div class="Description">

            			<p>Like all things, HTML has a specific structure when being used.  It's organized into a "tree-like" structure that allows for easy organization while also allowing rules to be applied to every branch or specific branches when code is written.

            			<div class="Description">

            			<p> Along with organizational structure, everything on a webpage is defined or put into a box.  This is a form of organization to allow you to help keep your webpage/HTML document organized and neat looking.  It also allows you to "jazz" it up by modifying the shape and what you want to put into your page, i.e. pictures, links, etc.  Like moving into or out of a house, this keeps everything in a group and defines where it will go.

        			The Coding Process

        			</div>

        				<div class="Description">

        				<p> As stated earlier, coding is the process of telling a computer what to do in its own language.  To do this we use a specific set of rules paired with our organizational structure to create a document that the computer then translates into a webpage.

        			Tags and Elements

        			</div>

        				<div class="Description">

                  <p> We use <b><em>tags</em></b> to define <b><em>elements</em></b> (or what makes up HTML code).  For example a tag such as &lt;b&gt; will define that you want the text to contain an element that is "bold".  Examples of tags are: &lt;b&gt; - bold, and &lt;em&gt; - italics.

        			Inline and Blocks

        			</div>

        				<div class="Description">

                  <p> <b><em>Inline</em></b> objects are tags you use in line of code to tell the computer how you want that code to display, e.g. using &lt;b&gt; to show that you wanted text in bold.  <b><em>Blocks</em></b> are tags that you use to put just that, blocks around your text to create form and spacing.  You can also modify these blocks by defining its height and width.

        			Attributes

        			</div>

        				<div class="Description">

                  <p><b><em>Attributes</em></b> are properties of HTML elements.  For example, we can use the &lt;href&gt; tag to create an anchor which is basically a link to another document (page, image, etc.).  An example of an &lt;href&gt; tag is this: &lt;a href="www.yahoo.com"&gt; Yahoo! &lt;/a&gt;.

            		Using CSS

            		</div>

           			 	<div class="Description">

            			<p> CSS is used to define the styles used in your webpage.  These styles define what color you want certain text to be, or what color you want the background, etc.
            			</p>

            			<p> CSS is similar to your regular HTML page, as you use a certain definitions (tags) to define these.  Organization is key as you define where and what you want to have in CSS.  For example, we would organize text as a class "text", then we could define say: color: red, or background-color: gray, etc.
            			</p>

                    </div>

                        <div class="Description">

                        <p> <b><em>Syntax</em></b> is like using proper grammar in coding.  If things are not written in a specific way the computer will not know how to translate it and something could go wrong.  For example typing:  &lt;b&gt;&lt;em&gt; syntax &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/b&gt; would be incorrect.  To be proper syntax &lt;em&gt; must be closed before &lt;b&gt; because that is how we defined the open tags.

<!-- I learned this specific example the hard way -->

            		Repetition is Painful

            		</div>

            			<div class="Description">

            			<p> Coding is a time consuming process, and it becomees more time consuming when you have to define everything on your page from text to style.  So by organizing things into using the <b><em>div</em></b> tag, we can group things into say; a "title", "text", "description", etc.  So that we can easily style that certain group in CSS.
            			</p>

            			<p> More importantly it is a huge pain to have to go back and fix every little thing if it is not organized.  When things are grouped it also becomes easier to figure out what went wrong so that this process becomes somewhat easier.  In the long run by doing this we don't have to have as much repetition and it makes us easier to write code and fix it.
